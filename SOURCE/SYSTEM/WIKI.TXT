                                 &Language design&

 The brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program
 and instruction pointer, as well as an array of at least 30,000 byte cells
 initialized to zero; a movable data pointer (initialized to point to the
 leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output
 (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the
 ASCII character encoding).

                           &The eight language commands&

  #>#   $increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).$
  #<#   $decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).$
  #+#   $increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.$
  #-#   $decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.$
  #.#   $output the byte at the data pointer.$
  #,#   $accept one byte of input, storing it in the byte at the data pointer.$
  #[#   $if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then jump it forward to$
      $the command after the matching ] command.$
  #]#   $if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then jump it back$
      $to the command after the matching [ command.$
