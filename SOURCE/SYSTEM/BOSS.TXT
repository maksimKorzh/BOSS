           $BOSS is the very first completed product of mine that I'm
           heavily using myself. Probably that happens because of my
           true belief in the programming potential of brainfuck. It
           would be nice if the community arises around this project.

           BOSS is an experimental brainfuck programming environment
           inspired by the rare ZX SPECTRUM computer which had BASIC
           interpreter as the only way to interact with. Most people
           used cassete recorders in order to load and save programs
           while I didn't have any, so no opportunity of saving work
           was ever possible, that's why I had to type in the source
           code of a desirable program every time over again...$
