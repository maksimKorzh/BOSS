# BOSS
Brainfuck Operating Shell System for DOS

# Overview

    BOSS is an experimental brainfuck programming environment
    inspired by the rare ZX SPECTRUM computer which had BASIC
    interpreter as the only way to interact with.
    
    BOSS is the very first completed product of mine that I'm
    heavily using myself. Probably that happens because of my
    true belief in the programming potential of brainfuck. It
    would be nice if the community arises around this project.


# Release
BOSS v0.1 has been released! See the 'release' tab.

# Installation

    BOSS is a native DOS application. It's assumed to run under
    freeDOS either in emulator or on the real hardware, both has
    been tested successfully. So in order to run BOSS you'll have
    to install freeDOS. The guide of how to do this might be found
    at freeDOS's website.

# Usage

    Use help command for commands reference. Text editing is only
    in replace mode at this moment. Use left/right arrow keys to
    move the cursor around the line and up/down to scroll text lines.
    When a desirable line is selected hit enter to edit it. When
    finished hit enter again or escape. Start each new file with
    new line. You can also edit /SYSTEM/SOURCE.BF file in any text
    editor you like and then simply perform 'run' command from BOSS.
